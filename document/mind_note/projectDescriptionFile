Project Description
Daniel Price & Ali Al-Kinani 

The project we are undertaking for this course is that of a historical map of international poetry. 
This map would allow people to contribute poetry translations + the time in which the poem was written, 
eventually creating a timeline and a map of the contributed poetry. 
The client for this project is the Centre for 21st Century Humanities at the University of Newcastle 
(the contact for the centre is Dr. Bill Pascoe - bill.pascoe@newcastle.edu.au .) 
They are hoping for this project to engage (i.e. be used by and contributed to by) users of varying backgrounds, 
be they academics, students or anyone with an interest in poetry. 
The project will mainly make use of Javascript, PHP and SQL (back end to front end, database, server side scripting and client side scripting.) 
Some, but not all, of the technical aspects of this project include:
-	User account management.
-	Users being able to add, edit or delete their contributions.
-	Poems and their translations being displayed in a collapsible viewer.
-	A map and a timeline for the contributions (both of which can be interactively employed by users to navigate the site, or contribute to it.)
-	Active user engagement (e.g. users can report other users for misconduct and can rate/rank the translations.)
